## Introduction
d:swarm is a **data integration and data modelling tool** that is based on the concept of [community sharing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharing). It is used for the lossless transformation of data from heterogeneous sources into a flexible ([elastic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticity_%28data_store%29)), graph-based data model that can be explicitly embedded in the (Linked) Open Data webgraph.

d:swarm is a **middle ware solution**. It forms the basis of all data management processes in a library or any other cultural institution dedicated to the handling of data and metadata.  Structurally, the DMP goes in between **existing data management systems** (e.g. Integrated Library Systems) and **existing front end applications** (e.g. the library catalogue or discovery system).

d:swarm takes care of the **improvement** of the data quality facilitating the deduplication, merging and [FRBRization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records) of bibliographic data, their semantic enrichment and publication as [LOD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_data).

d:swarm channels all **institutional data flows** and creates a highly customized master record for every individual resource as a [Single Version of the Truth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_version_of_the_truth) (SVOT).

d:swarm is a web application that runs in all modern web browsers.
